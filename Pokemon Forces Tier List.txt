							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
					              [ Psychic ]
			    (Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					     Pressure/Unnerve/Psychic Power


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses; Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Whereas most Pokemon are biased toward specific sets, which serve as the primary cause for their exalted viability; Mewtwo is able to continuously adapt its sets on the fly, allowing it to always keep its opponents guessing. Its perfectly placed stats leave it with no major vulnerabilites, and its access to a nearly unlimited movepool, encompassing every Type in the game, makes it nigh uncounterable. Simply figuring out the opposing Mewtwo's set, is itself, a daunting undertaking, and actually managing to successfully faint it, is something that will usually only be possible after a very long struggle between both sides. Mewtwo's combination of attributes makes it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, powerful teammates, signature items, and phenomenal ability; This Genetic Masterpiece proves itself to be a powerful Pokemon that is second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.


						       Torterra
						     [Grass/Ground]
			    (Hp: 155/Atk: 309/Def: 254/SpA: 21/SpD: 185/Spe: 156) BST: 1080
					    Barricade/Weather Guard/Overgrow


Descripton: Torterra's massive overall bulk, paired with items like White Herb, Lax Incense, Sweet Apple, and especially, Flower Sweet, allows it to continuously switch in to absorb a variety of powerful hits during a match. Additionally, its expansive support movepool, consisting of moves like Stealth Rock, Parting Shot, Rapid Spin, Express Heal, and Defog, paired with its colossal Base 309 Attack, makes it one of the most effective and threatening Support Pokemon in the game, as its Earthquake can often take over half of an opponent's health, while Rapid Spin and Parting Shot can be used to gain the speed advantage, or weaken the enemy for one of Torterra's allies, respectively. Finally, its Ability, Barricade--cuts the damage of opposing Ice-Type attacks down to 1/4 of their initial damage, granting Torterra an effective neutrality, and further bolstering its bulk. Notably, a healthy Torterra can absorb at least 2 hits from most Mewtwo sets, making it a potentially viable switch in a pinch. It can also hold its own against Meloetta, check Tapu Koko, and survive Shell Smash boosted hits from Dialga, including its Fire Blast, and, when at full health, a Dawn Stone boosted Draco Meteor.


							Kyogre
						       [Water]
			    (Hp: 160/Atk: 240/Def: 180/SpA: 320/SpD: 280/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					           Drizzle/Antipathy

Description: Thanks to its fantastic Special Attack stat, amazing Typing, access to the powerful Water Spout, and its amazing Ability, Drizzle; Kyogre is a menace to fight against, and is the most centralizing Pokemon in the game. With Choice Scarf, and a set of Water Spout/Origin Pulse/Thunder/Ice Beam, Kyogre is capable of shredding through almost anything that isn't a dedicated resist, through the power of its high BP moves, and impressive coverage. Kyogre can also run Choice Specs to punish players that were expecting a Scarfed set, and hit the Tier even harder. Wave Incense sacrifices the speed of Scarf, and the power of Specs, but grants Kyogre incredible power with its Water-Type moves, without locking it out of the rest of its set. Finally, and best of all, is its Sea Incense set; With a set of Water Spout/Origin Pulse/Thunder/Thunder Wave, Kyogre can not only outspeed all but the fringest of Pokemon due to the Sea Incense boost, but can exploit its deadly combination of Rain and Paralysis to potentially cripple, or even check its own dedicated answers, allowing it to wreak havoc with its powerful attacking moves. Its amazing ability to threaten the entire tier, whilst potentially enabling certain teams through its Rain setting utility, not only makes Kyogre one of the best Pokemon in the game, but far and away, the most centralizing.


							Dialga
						    [Steel/Dragon]
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to the best Ability, and one of the best moves in the game--in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Thanks to these two powerful resources, Dialga is capable of fulfilling a multitude of roles, from bulky tank, dedicated offense, hazard support, or even various hybrids of these sets--all while maintaining its Ability to perform excellently during games, and even potentially sweep the opponent. Dialga's ability to run nearly any kind of set--including frightening mixed sets, while synergizing with nearly every viable Item in the Tier--is unrivaled, and it is easily the most customizable Pokemon in the entire game. When building a Team, it is vital that players prepare an answer for this Master of Time, lest they find their ephemeral existence ground to dust.


						       Meloetta
						   [Normal/Psychic]
			    (Hp: 170/Atk: 108/Def: 177/SpA: 288/SpD: 288/Spe: 170) BST: 1201
					    Serene Grace/Ensemble/Defiant


Description: Despite its appearingly average Special Attack, Meloetta's damage output is significantly bolstered by its Special Mechanic (SPM), which boosts the power of all Sound-Based moves by 50% when used by it. This mechanic, combined with its obscure Typing, resourceful moves, and above average speed, all help to make Meloetta into a dangerous offensive utility Pokemon. Notably, Meloetta is one of the few Pokemon capable of brawling with Mewtwo, under certain circumstances, as it can shrug off everything short of a Brutal Swing or Dark Pulse, the former of which, can be mitigated for at least one hit via Protector. All of these factors together make it an incredibly dangerous Pokemon, and caution should be exercised when opposing it.


						       Tapu Fini
						     [Water/Fairy]
			    (Hp: 200/Atk: 195/Def: 175/SpA: 275/SpD: 260/Spe: 155) BST: 1260
					   Misty Blessing/Antipathy/Telepathy


Description: Tapu Fini's fantastic Water/Fairy Typing allows it to check a variety of Pokemon that would otherwise severely threaten the Tier, such as Palkia, Keldeo, most Kyogre sets, and in many cases, Dialga, and Xerneas. Misty Blessing also notably improves its overall bulk, as it allows Tapu Fini to survive powerful Poison-Type attacks that would otherwise be certain OHKO's. Nature's Madness is the preferred offensive move for Fini, due to its doubled power against boosted targets (or in GeoXern's case, quadrupeled power); Stealth Rock is the best pick for the second slot, as its bulk makes it one of the safest setters in the game; and finally, Milk Drink and Teleport are the best picks for the final two slots, as they bolster its already amazing Support capabilities, so as to leave its set with no immanent vulnerabilites.



						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit onto every Team and immediately improve the cluster's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players will want to have at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemon's full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are capable of fulfilling certain roles with with a certain degree of success, but lack either the consistency or environment to fully capitalize on their positive attributes. These Pokemon are typically outclassed by the Pokemon in the three Tiers above them due to either lacking a sufficient number of relevant strengths, or possessing too many exploitable weaknessness, however many of these Pokemon may be capable of rising to the B-Tier, or even the A-Tier, should either the meta change, or new sets end up being discovered within their current Meta. These Pokemon may require considerable skill to play, but may just provide the necessary resources to help players gain traction in the Meta.

D-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that are almost completely outclassed by the Pokemon in the Tiers above them, oftentimes due to a number of intrinsic factors, which may never be completely remedied even with new set discoveries or drastic Meta changes. Pokemon often merit this Tier, due to either insufficient stats, poor typing(s), insufficient movepools, or being completely outclassed in the few roles they do have by other, significantly more powerful Pokemon (some of which are even other variants of themselves). Researching these Pokemon may be helpful, should an opponent endeavor to use one of these Pokemon in a game, however well-designed Teams will likely have resources that can handle one, or even many of these Pokemon, regardless. As such, these Pokemon are not helpful for gaining any traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier; Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, it could be entirely possible for these Pokemon to be viable in lower Tiers, however in this Tier, these Pokemon fail to accomplish anything of value, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

					    Kyogre-Check (Sponsors) Tier List
Summary: Measures how effectively certain Pokemon can handle Kyogre's Rain Boosted Water Spout while still providing valuable utility to the rest of the Team. Absolute checks may therefore be ranked lower than weaker checks, if they fail to provide significant utility to the Team beyond singularly checking Kyogre.

S-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can not only consistently check Kyogre, but are capable of excelling in the Meta and substantially benefitting Teams even if it is absent. For these Pokemon, checking Kyogre is only one of many things that they can do, and they would still serve as indispensible members of players' Teams, even without a Kyogre to manage.

A-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can most efficently check Kyogre whilst still providing utility to the player's Team; These Pokemon's viability is heightened by their matchup against Kyogre, but isn't contigent upon it.

B-Class: Pokemon in this class tend to do excellent jobs at checking Kyogre in a vacuum, but possess other significant weaknesses that create a significant opportunity cost when using them for this role. Pokemon can also end up in this Tier if they have otherwise favorable matchups against the rest of the Tier, but only check Kyogre under certain circumstances.

C-Class: Pokemon in this Tier can check, and even counter some of Kyogre's moves, but otherwise tend to have inconsistent or unreliable matchups against the rest of the Tier.

						Dark Triad Tier List
Summary: The Dark Triad is a name designed to refer to the Trio of the apparent three best setup sweepers in the game: Dialga, Groudon, and Zekrom.

- Awkward Defensive Typing

- Awkward Typing, given its ability; Does not synergize with the very Sun Teams it helps enable
- Poor Synergy with Teams, in general
- Massive Bulk is hindered by no relevant resistances
- Because of this, its bulk mainly just serves as a vehicle to help it set up, making it predictable
- Drought strengthens Mewtwo's Psycho Fire, allowing it to deal massive damage to it, even without dedicated coverage


							Mewtwo Set
Preferred Spread EVs
4 Hp/92 Atk/156 SpA/4 SpD/252 Spe (Hasty: +Spe, -Def)

Explanation
4 Hp/4 SpD - Just enough EVs to always survive a Light Ball boosted Electro Ball from Tapu Koko from Full Hp
92 Atk - With this investment, Mewtwo's Gunk Shot will always be a guaranteed OHKO against 0-4Hp/0 Def Arceus-Fairy
156 SpA/252 Spe - Remaining EVs; Maximizes Mewtwo's Speed and Power within the parameters of the aforementioned investment
