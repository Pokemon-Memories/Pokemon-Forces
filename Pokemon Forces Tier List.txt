Pokemon Forces Developer Tier List

(106 Total)

							S-Tier

							Mewtwo
			    (Hp: 170/Atk: 335/Def: 185/SpA: 338/SpD: 185/Spe: 187) BST: 1400
					     Pressure/Unnerve/Psychic Power


Description: Between its peerless offenses, blistering speed, and its perfectly distributed defenses, Mewtwo is an unparallaled force of mass destruction in this Meta. Its main attacking set of Expanding Force, Aura Sphere, Aurora Beam, and Brutal Swing allows it to decimate nearly any threat that stands in its way, and its auxillary moves such as Poison Jab, Electro Ball, Poltergeist, Earthquake, and Nasty Plot give it the perfect set of tools to make it nigh uncounterable. Simply getting the opposing Mewtwo to faint, is itself--a daunting task that may often require one of more dedicated answers, and when compounded by the additional need to manage the various powerful teammates that Mewtwo can hand-pick to shield itself from harm, makes even accomplishing this much next to impossible. Mewtwo's combination of attributes make it a force to be reckoned with, and when paired with its dangerous unpredictability, signature items, and powerful Abilities, makes this Genetic Masterpiece into a powerful Pokemon that's second to none. We dreamed of creating the most powerful Pokemon, and we succeeded.


							Dialga
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator


Description: Dialga's massive defensive stats, stratospheric offenses, and excellent Type-Combination already make it a force to be reckoned with, however what truly sets it apart from the rest of its peers is access to the best Ability and Move in the game, in Regenerator and Shell Smash respectively. Whereas most Pokemon are either dedicated defensive or offensive Pokemon, with little overlap into the opposite field, Dialga's combination of choice attributes grants it the ability to simultaneously perform both roles with great proficiency, as a sufficiently invested Dialga is capable of surviving a number of super-effective hits, including Earthquakes from opposing Life Orb Infernape, with Defensive Investment, and Aura Spheres from Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo and opposing boosted Dialga, with Specially Defensive Investment--while possessing the power after a Shell Smash to potentially decimate even some of the bulkiest Pokemon in the Tier. In addition to these incredible basal privileges that Dialga possesses, its unrivaled combination of attributes make it the Pokemon most synergistic with Items in the entire game; With the right sets and investment, Dialga can viably run anything from Metal Coat, Sitrus Berry, and Sweet Apple, for sustainability, to Chople Berry, Shuca Berry, or Power Bracer for immediate bulk, and the aforementioned Metal Coat, in addition to Adamant Orb, Life Orb, Expert Belt, Zap Plate, Electric Gem, Fist Plate, Fighting Gem, Pinch Berries, Moon Stone, and, most notably, Dusk Stone, Dawn Stone, and Weakness Policy, for offensive utility. With the last three, particularly, a 252 Atk Dialga with an Attack boosting nature is capable of even OHKO'ing a 252 Hp/252 Def Tapu Fini with a Defensive nature, while Dialga with a Dawn Stone and Draco Meteor, is capable of annihilating even many Assault Vest Lando-T sets, sometimes without any needing any SpA investment at all. With Weakness Policy, Dialga can effectively minimize its offensive investment, to fully commit itself to its massive bulk, allowing it to survive Super-Effective hits even from Pokemon like Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo and Life Orb Deoxys-Attack, whilst using Shell Smash on top of its Weakness Policy boosted stats, to reach levels of power that are nigh-uncounterable. Because of these factors, paired with its powerful intrinsic capabilities, and incredible synergy with both supporting Teammates, as well as its nigh-unlimited list of Items available to it, Dialga stands alone as the single most customizable and versatile Pokemon in the entire game, surpassing even Mewtwo in this regard, and together with its aforementioned peer, reign far and above the rest of the Tier with distinct, yet nigh-equivalent levels of power that can only be described as fitting for these Legendary Pokemon.


						      Arceus-Ghost
			    (Hp: 240/Atk: 200/Def: 160/SpA: 320/SpD: 320/Spe: 160) BST: 1400
					       	       Multitype


Description: Thanks to its Massive Hp stat, colossal Special Attack stat, and ownership of one of the highest Special Defense stats in the game, Arceus-Ghost poses as one of the most dangerous set-up Sweepers in the entire Tier. With a set of Judgment, Calm Mind, Double Team, and Recover, Arceus-Ghost can not only raise its resilience to unbreakable levels via Calm Mind, but can compensate for its only true weakness, in it's middling Speed stat, via the Speed boost that Double Team provides, enabling it, through the use of its powerful Judgment, that exchanges Ghost's Immunities with mere Resistances--to sweeps Teams with near impunity. Even without setting up, however, Arceus Ghost is still highly formidable; Its Special Defense stat enables it to withstand blows from many of the strongest Special Attackers in the Tier, while its Physical Defense, while relatively average, finds itself bolstered by Arceus' massive Hp and Ghost-Typing to the point where it can still tank hits from powerful Pokemon like Mega Gallade and many Shell Smash Genesect sets in a pinch. The number of things that genuniely stop Arceus-Ghost are infinitesimal, and once it has set up, it is only a matter of time until its adversaries all face Judgment.


						       Tapu Fini
			    (Hp: 200/Atk: 155/Def: 195/SpA: 275/SpD: 260/Spe: 155) BST: 1280
					       Stamina/Antipathy/Telepathy


Description: Thanks to its fantastic defensive typing, excellent bulk, and expansive selection of utility moves, Tapu Fini arguably possesses the most utility out of any Pokemon in the game; Thanks to its typing and overwhelming bulk, it can check common sets from a substantial amount of Pokemon, including Groudon, Keldeo, Kyogre, Palkia, and even Mewtwo and Dialga, while its access to Heart Swap allows it neutralize a large amount of Special Set-Up Sweepers including Sea Incense Phione, Sea Incense Palkia, Magearna-Original, and even potentially Geomancy Xerneas, and Shell Smash Dialga sets, due to its peerless Typing and inpenetrable Special Bulk. Misty Blessing also greatly benefits Tapu Fini, as it partially releases it from the need to run a healing Item for longevity, effectively granting Tapu Fini two Item slots, which can accomodate anything from Berries, Utility Umbrella, or even an additional Healing Item, further accentuating its already exemplary bulk. While it may possess more weaknesses than its colleague, Landorus-Therian, it easily compensates through its excellent synergy with a variety of Teams, fantastic role compression capabilities, and its unique ability to neutralize Pokemon that would otherwise be top-tier contenders in its absence. Tapu Fini is the single greatest Defensive Support Pokemon in the game, and Players' Teams will surely find themselves delighted, should this legendary Pokemon grace them with its presence.


						       Victreebel
			    (Hp: 200/Atk: 224/Def: 215/SpA: 224/SpD: 185/Spe: 162) BST: 1210
					       Stamina/Pollution/Gluttony


Description: Thanks to its fantastic Typing, impregnable defenses, and access to the Ability Stamina, Victreebel is one of the sturdiest and most difficult Pokemon to break in the entire game. Due to its plethora of resistances, most notably three Double-Resists in Electric, Fairy, and Grass, alongside resistances to Water, Fighting, Steel, and Normal, Victreebel is capable of walling, and completely shutting down the majority of sets from Pokemon like Tapu Koko, Keldeo, Arceus-Fairy, Lilligant, Meloetta, Dialga, and even its fellow support Pokemon, Tapu Fini--whislt being able to hit the majority of the Pokemon Super-Effectively through its joint access to Apple Acid and Venoshock, a combination that makes it nearly impossible for opposing Pokemon to switch in against it. Additionally, it also has a vide variety of items to choose from; With Sweet Apple, Victreebel can amplify its already amazing Ability in Stamina, by allowing it to restore upwards of 40% upon switching out, while Utility Umbrella allows it to counter opposing Kyogre without having to worry much about being worn down by its powerful Water Spout. Lax Incense compliments Victreebel's already fantastic bulk by granting it a proper form of passive recovery, and if it wants to instead prioritize dealing more damage to dispatch threats more quickly, it can even run Toxic Orb to annihilate threats that would otherwise only be 2HKO'd without it. It's Psychic, Ice, and Flying weaknesses leave it vulnerable to dangerous attackers like Mewtwo, Kyurem, and common Tapu Koko sets respectively, however these flaws can easily be compensated for through the use of its other Teammates, which can synergize efficiently with Victreebel's already obscure Type combination to create nigh impenetrable cores. 



						     Tier Assesments
S-Tier: Reserved for the absolute most powerful Pokemon; These Pokemon can fit onto every Team and immediately improve the cluster's viability through its presence alone, having the potential not only to fortify already powerful Teams, but elevate to viability Teams, Pokemon, and strategies that would otherwise be suboptimal without them. There are few, if any downsides to selecting a Pokemon from this Tier, and it is crucial that opponents have answers to these threats if their Team is to gain any traction in the Meta. 

A-Tier: Reserved for exemplary Pokemon that either fulfil a multitude of roles, or accomplish their specific roles with with peerless excellence. Pokemon in this Tier tend to have only minor weaknesses, all of which are almost completely compensated for by the immense utility provided for players' Teams, and the profound effect they have on the Meta. These are the Electrons that orbit the Nuclei of the Tier, and players will want to have at least one of these Pokemon on their Team if they hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

B-Tier: Reserved for Pokemon that serve noticeable functions in the Meta, with varying degrees of success. Many of the Pokemon in this Tier have profound, or even rare strengths which cannot be found in the A-Tier proper, but possess glaring weaknesses that prevent them from gaining a spot in the aforementioned Tier themselves. Strategic play and additional support may be required to bring out these Pokemon's full potential, however when played optimally, they may be able to give Players the particular utility they'll need to gain traction in the Meta.

C-Tier: Pokemon in this Tier aren't necessarily bad; In fact, many of this Tier's Pokemon have utilities that theroetically rival even those of the A-Tier's. Despite these theroetical positives, however, they are oftentimes defeated through crippling deficiencies elsewhere, whether it be from extreme damage potenial that's crippled by a lacklustre movepool, massive stats compromised by situational or outright subpar Abilities, or amazing Abilities and unique properties lashed to insurmountably passive or otherwise impotent users, many of these Pokemon's strengths are either overwhelmed by their weaknesses, or simply never have a chance to display themselves from the onset. Despite their many weaknesses, however, some of these Pokemon still manage to occassionally offer benefits to Teams that can bring their strengths to the forefront whilst covering for their weaknesses. If these Pokemon are to be used, they should preferrably be paired with higher ranked A-Tiers or S-Tiers to help maintain a basal measure of viability, should they falter. Players can benefit from studying these Pokemon to increase their matchup knowledge, however they aren't truly necessary to gain traction in the Meta.

Unranked: Reserved for Pokemon that were experimented with during development, but failed to meet the Meta's standard to justify placement in a proper Tier. Pokemon in this Category should be viewed less as incorrigibly unviable, and more as members of the boundary at which Ubers and OU converge. Since this game is primarily balanced around Ubers, and the other Tiers haven't been properly explored or documented as of yet, certain Pokemon failing to attain viability in a Meta beyond their power level is an inevitability. Should the game reach a point where additional lower Tiers can be developed more thoroughly, however, these Pokemon may find themselves in resourceful, or even dominant positions in those lower Tiers based off their particular merits. For Ubers, however, these Pokemon fail to meet the mark, and should realistically never be used if Players hope to gain any traction in the Meta.

						Kyogre-Check Tier List
Summary: Measures how effectively certain Pokemon can handle Kyogre's Rain Boosted Water Spout while still providing valuable utility to the rest of the Team. Absolute checks may therefore be ranked lower than weaker checks, if they fail to provide significant utility to the Team beyond singularly checking Kyogre.

S-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can not only consistently check Kyogre, but are capable of excelling in the Meta and substantially benefitting Teams even if it is absent. For these Pokemon, checking Kyogre is only one of many things that they can do, and they would still serve as indispensible members of players' Teams, even without a Kyogre to manage.

A-Class: Reserved for Pokemon that can most efficently check Kyogre whilst still providing utility to the player's Team; These Pokemon's viability is heightened by their matchup against Kyogre, but isn't contigent upon it.

B-Class: Pokemon in this class tend to do excellent jobs at checking Kyogre in a vacuum, but possess other significant weaknesses that create a significant opportunity cost when using them for this role. Pokemon can also end up in this Tier if they have otherwise favorable matchups against the rest of the Tier, but only check Kyogre under certain circumstances.

C-Class: Pokemon in this Tier can check, and even counter some of Kyogre's moves, but otherwise tend to have inconsistent or unreliable matchups against the rest of the Tier.

						Dark Triad Tier List
Summary: The Dark Triad is a name designed to refer to the Trio of the apparent three best setup sweepers in the game: Dialga, Groudon, and Zekrom. These Pokemon are incredibly powerful, especially with the right Items and Abilities, and practically necessitate at least one dedicated or semi-dedicated answer to them (usually Landorus-Therian).

Members
1. Dialga
Common Items
- Dawn Stone
- Sweet Apple
- Weakness Policy
- Metal Coat
- Protector
- Chople Berry
- Shuca Berry

Common Moves
Constant = Shell Smash
- Breaking Swipe
- Dragon Pulse
- Iron Head
- Draco Meteor
- Flash Cannon
- Stealth Rock
- Aura Sphere
- Thunder
- Fire Blast

Preferred Ability
Regenerator

Summary: Thanks to its solid typing, incredible bulk, its excellent Ability--Regenerator, and its access to Shell Smash, Dialga can afford to run a variety of sets, ranging from dedicated offense, defensive support, or even combinations of the two, with little to no consequences. When its stats are neutral, its invested Special bulk can potentially allow it to survive Moonblasts from +2 Geomancy Xerneas, or even Aura Spheres from Mewtwo, while its Shell Smash boosts allow it to even OHKO 252 SpD Arceus-Fairy from full HP. Protector ensures that Dialga can survive at least a single contact-Move--including Priority moves, while Chople Berry and Shuca Berry ensure that Dialga can survive opposing Mewtwo Aura Sphere and Focus Blasts, or Merciless Marshadow Shatter Fists, and Protean Infernape Earthquakes, respectively, while remaining healthy. Metal Coat bolsters Dialga's already impressive bulk by improving its longevity, allowing it to better stay in to set up Rocks or sweep. Additionally, Sweet Apple can be used as a means of granting Dialga an instant Recover upon switching out, allowing it to more efficiently cycle itself to restore its HP. Lastly, Weakness Policy allows for Bulky Dialga to prey upon unsuspecting opponents seeking to deal chip damage on it, or otherwise finish it with supposedly lethal moves, and reverse the situation on them, potentially allowing it to even overwhelm its checks, and Dawn Stone allows Dialga to run its dangerous Physical moves, while blasting through any opposing Pokemon that may be running Protector, or are otherwise too bulky for either of its normal Physical or Special sets, by nailing them with a powered up Draco Meteor. Dialga has an extensive selection of moves and items to choose from, and it is easily, not only the most customizable Member of the Dark Triad, but one of the most adaptable and powerful Pokemon in the entire game.

2. Zekrom
Common Items
- Light Ball
- Life Orb
- Ice Gem
- Dawn Stone

Common Moves
Constant = Dragon Dance
- Bolt Strike
- Royal Rampage
- Flying Deluge
- Slush Switch
- Ice Punch
- Blizzard
- Fusion Bolt

Preferred Ability
Teravolt

Summary: Due to its amazing Items, incredible attack and speed stats, and fantastic Abilities and STAB moves, Zekrom is capable of immediately pressuring opposing Teams even before it sets up. Zekrom will almost always want to hold a Light Ball as its Item, as it allows Zekrom to break past Pokemon that could handle a boosted Bolt Strike like Arceus-Fairy, and some Mewtwo sets, whilst allowing it preserve its remaining health after a Dragon Dance, unlike Life Orb. Royal Rampage is also important, as it not only allows Zekrom to beat other dragons, but to even OHKO Dialga after a Dragon Dance boost, which its next best coverage move, Earthquake--cannot accomplish even after a boost. The final moveslot depends on the set that Zekrom wants to run. If it wants to prioritize escaping its uncomfortable matchups, Slush Switch is its best option, while a 252 SpA set with a SpA boosting nature, and either a Dawn Stone, or an Ice Gem--OHKOs most common Lando-Ts, while doing the most damage to opposing Groudon. Finally, Flying Deluge sets Zekrom apart from its peers, in that it makes Zekrom the only member in the entire Triad capable of OHKO'ing an opposing Lando-T, a feat it can accomplish, provided Zekrom at least has a neutral Atk stat stage at the time it strikes. Zekrom isn't perfect; Revenge Killers like Kyurem-Black, or Common Scarf-Pokemon like Calyrex-Shadow can easily dispatch of it, even after Dragon Dance's stat boosts, and Grass-Type Pokemon--especially Lilligant, can potentially tank its hits long enough to pick it off, however even with these obstacles, Zekrom remains a force to be reckoned with in the Tier, and is easily one of the best setup Sweepers in the game.

3. Groudon
Common Items
- Full Incense
- White Herb
- Yache Berry

Common Moves
Constant = Dragon Dance
- Precipice Blades
- Flare Blitz
- Swords Dance
- Mineral Cannon

Preferred Ability
Drought

Summary: Thanks to its amazing typing, powerful attacks, and Full Incense, an Item that grants a 50% boost to Ground-Type and Fire-Type moves in the Sun, Groudon with its four most common moves serves as an absolute menace to opposing Teams, and can easily cleave through opposing players that underestimate it, or otherwise come unprepared. Unfortunately, Groudon is not without its issues, however: Lando-T completely ignores its powerful Precipice Blades, forcing it to rely on Flare Blitz for damage, and while 252 Hp Groudon can potentially chain Dragon Dance with Swords Dance on a hard switch to Lando-T to deal massive damage to it with Flare Blitz, this strategy fails if Groudon's opponent stays in and decides to fight it, as Groudon will almost always lack the remaining HP after an encounter to set up again. The situation gets even worse against Tapu Fini, as none of Groudon's moves--even its uncommon ones, are capable of breaking through it, even at +2, while Tapu Fini can stall by Heart-Swapping its boosts away, and deal massive damage through Nature's Madness, in return. Lastly, Groudon, even after a Dragon Dance, with a Full Incense boosted Precipice Blades--is unable to OHKO an opposing Kyurem-Black from Full Hp. The opposing Kyurem, however, can not only deal massive damage to Groudon, through its Snowball boosted Ice Shards, but can simply OHKO it outright with Glacial Strike, should it be healthy enough. Because of its limited movepool, reliance on Full Incense for its overwhelming power, potential speed-ties with other Base 160s like Scarf Kyogre, and multiple, powerful checks, Groudon finds itself at the bottom of the pack with the Dark Triad, however it should not be underestimated; Its Ground-Typing makes it the only member of the Triad that can consistently check Dragon Dance Zekrom, as both opposing Zekrom and Dialga get destroyed by Royal Rampage. Furthermore, its massive immediate power grants it the means to potentially punch holes in its checks defenses that can weaken them for another Pokemon to sweep. Groudon may not have the same customizability as Dialga, or the coverage that its peer Zekrom possesses, however if the opponent is sufficiently weakened, or otherwise finds themselves underestimating this powerful Pokemon, they will be rendered powerless to act, as they helplessly watch their Team get annihilated by it.

						     Former S-Tiers

							Dialga
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 280/Def: 210/SpA: 280/SpD: 180/Spe: 160) BST: 1340
					     Pressure/Telepathy/Regenerator


Description: As component of the Creation Trio, and a Member of the Dark Triad, Dialga does not disappoint; Whereas most other Pokemon either have to fully invest in their Speed stats to stay ahead of the Tier, like Mewtwo or Keldeo, or hope they can find opportunities to set up and sweep, like its fellow Triad members, Groudon and Zekrom, Dialga is a Pokemon that plays by its own set of rules and thrives under them. With a combination of a colossal HP stat, above average cumulative Defenses, and offenses that nearly break the 300s, Dialga already had multiple advantages over the bulk of the Tier, however what truly sets it apart from its peers, is its unrivaled combination of the premier defensive ability, Regenerator, and access to arguably the best set-up move in the game, Shell Smash. While most set-up sweepers have to carefully navigate the opposing Pokemon's Team over many turns in hopes of finding an opportunity to set up, the combination of Regenerator and Shell Smash allows Dialga to not only attempt setting up repeatedly, but to forgo any Speed investment whatsoever to better invest in Bulk, enabling to survive a multitude of otherwise fatal attacks, while still being fast enough after a boost to outspeed even Choice Scarf Timid Kyogre. Dialga's ability to oscillate between bulky tank and offensive sweeper, makes it easily the single most customizable Pokemon in the entire game, and its uncountable list of viable moves, EV spreads, and Item choices gives it a level of unpredictability that can rival even Mewtwo's.

Why it fell: Due to powerful threats like Landorus-T, Victreebel, and Tapu Fini, which could all take its boosted hits and frustrate it with Intimidate/Ground-Moves, Super-Effective Apple Acids, and Heart Swap, respectively, Dialga became a Pokemon that struggled to truly gain and keep its momentum during a match. Eventually, it became forced to run primarily defensive and supportive sets, which found themselves pressured heavily by powerful Pokemon like Mewtwo and Infernape, and outclassed on this front by its own checks, namely, Lando, Victreebel, and Fini. Surrounded by issues on both sides, namely, offensively and defensively, it appeared as though it was no longer quite capable of matching the standard of the highest Tier.

Why it rose again: It was discovered that, if Dialga invests fully into Special Defense, with a SpD boosting nature, and additional HP investment, it is capable of surviving nearly any hit in the game, including Aura Spheres and Focus Blasts from Mewtwo, and Earth Powers and Apple Acids from common Lando-T and Victreebel sets respectively, after the stat drops from Shell Smash. These discoveries enabled it to effectively run Weakness Policy sets more consistently, allowing it to blast through even many of its checks when the conditions were right, without having to worry about being picked off by opposing threats before the Item could get a chance to activate. Additionally, and perhaps, most importantly: Dawn Stone sets were discovered for Dialga, which enabled it to run Physical Sets again that could pressure the Specially Defensive sets that many of the Tiers walls were trending towards, whilst being able to blast through certain checks like opposing Dialga, Protector Meloetta, Specially Defensive Victreebel, and Specially Defensive Ho-Oh, with the overwhelming power of a Dawn Stone boosted Draco Meteor. These factors, not only enabled Dialga to pick its checks and win conditions, while building around its vulnerabilities with its teammates, but had the added benefit of validating many of its auxillary sets, due to the attention the Meta would need to expend to manage its strongest ones. Thanks to all of these factors, Dialga is arguably more powerful than it was even before it dropped, and debatably even stands as a worthy contender for the number one spot.


						      Arceus-Fairy
			    (Hp: 230/Atk: 252/Def: 210/SpA: 310/SpD: 230/Spe: 173) BST: 1400
						       Multitype


Description: With access to an innumerable list of moves, amazing stats, and arguably one of the best Typings in the entire game, Arceus-Fairy outclasses most Pokemon before its first move is even selected. Its blistering Speed stat allows it to outmanuver threats like Dialga, Meloetta, and even Landorus-Therian, while its incredible cumulative bulk, and Special Bulk in particular, allows a 252 SpD build to not only survive a charged Expanding Force from Adrenaline Orb Mewtwo from full HP after Stealth Rocks damage, but to even survive a Full HP Water Spout from Choice Scarf Modest Kyogre after a Calm Mind boost, even without any HP or Def investment. Its incredible damage output, combined with its superb defenses, has led to Judgment, Calm Mind, and Recover being its moves of choice, with the forth slot being open for anything to Flamethrower for Steels like Genesect, Royal Turbulence or Stealth Rock for Team support, Moongeist Beam for Calyrex-S, or even stalling moves like Toxic or Substitute. Because of its massive bulk, devastating Judgment, and impregnable defenses granted through Calm Mind and Recover, Arceus-Fairy serves an invaluable asset to Teams, being capable of handling of shutting down entire Teams and occasionally even beating its own checks. Rewarding to play with, and frightening to stand against, Arceus-Fairy holds a presence in matches befitting of a true god; When facing it, one ought to come prepared, and exercise caution, lest they face Judgment.

Why it fell: At its peak, Arceus-Fairy was so powerful that it not only caused drastic meta changes, which persist at least partially even now, but even warranted a number of nerfs--namely, nerfs to its Speed stat, Bubble hitting Fairy-Types Super-Effectively, and Grass-Types resisting Fairy-Type attacks, due to its uncontested ability to invalidate anything slower than it with the press of a button. While Arceus-Fairy could initially manage these changes by running Glacial Strike or Flamethrower to handle opposing Grass and/or Steel-Type Pokemon, eventually, additional changes came about:

Registeel was noticeably buffed by the introduction of Regi Ball, which allowed it to do more than merely tank Arceus' attacks, and retaliate with massive Super-Effective Damage as well, Venoshock was changed to target the opposing Pokemon's Defense stat, enabling threats like Eternatus to bypass its Calm Mind boosts and potentially OHKO in return, Infernape's offensive stats were buffed to align with the modern power level, while Gunk Shot's BP was buffed, which enabled it, and other powerful breakers to potentially OHKO it, while making it a liability for Teams that also wanted to run Lilligant or Tapu Fini, and Victreebel was discovered to be a viable Pokemon, and adjusted to be a proper Top-Tier, causing Arceus-Fairy's already dwindling power to be impaired even more, as, not could Victreebel run Stab-boosted Venoshocks to hit it extremely hard, as opposed to its next best answer's, Lilligant's--Bubble, but it forced Arceus-Fairy to depend nearly exclusively on Calm Mind boosted Glacial Strike to have any chance of breaking past it, which not only left it more vulnerable to the Steels it already struggled against, like Registeel, but opened the floodgates for other dangerous Steels that it otherwise could have checked like Genesect, which, when compounded by its reliance on all four moves to maximize its efficacy, resulted in Arceus-Fairy being a liability not just for Pokemon with similar weaknesses (such as Lilligant and Tapu Fini), as before, but for the entire Team.

All of these factors together were already more than enough to result in a drop from the S-Tier, however, another massive blow would still be dealt yet to Arceus-Fairy, in the discovery of Ho-Oh, a powerful Pokemon, that not only resisted its Stab, as many other Pokemon already did, but was capable of ignoring even its Glacial Strike, which could at least threaten Victreebel if the circumstances were right. When paired with the right coverage moves, and sufficient boosts, as is the case with Xerneas, the Fairy-Typing can be a massive aid for its wielders, that's more than capable of punching holes into even the bulkiest Teams. When left to itself, however, it's efficacy diminishes significantly, as had become apparent from the current state of Arceus-Fairy in the meta. Burderned with the choice between running a predictable Set-Up set, and getting walled by much of the threats that it help bring into the forefront, or abandoning its power for an all out attacking set, which would find itself outclassed by more powerful attackers such as Mewtwo or Infernape, the former contender for the Meta's Throne was left with nowhere to go but down.

4 Hp/4 SpD - Just enough EVs to always survive a Light Ball boosted Electro Ball from Tapu Koko from Full Hp
92 Atk - With this investment, Mewtwo's Gunk Shot will always be a guaranteed OHKO against 0-4Hp/0 Def Arceus-Fairy
156 SpA/252 Spe - Remaining EVs; Maximizes Mewtwo's Speed and Power within the parameters of the aforementioned investment

Note: As of recent, Psychic Power's damage boost has been reduced from x1.3 to x1.1, and Mewtwo has lost access to Gunk Shot. It is now recommended to fully invest into SpA, as Poison Jab doesn't net any notable K.O.'s through investment
